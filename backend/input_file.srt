1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Guys, look at that mechanical tower.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
It's surreal. It's wonderful.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Hey, Marquinhos!

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
You brought your girlfriend.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Yes, this is Regina.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Nice to meet you, Susana.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Susana, Pedro, Katia.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How are you?

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We were talking about Carlinhos' birthday.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I love this story.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Carlinhos is a friend of ours who had a party in the neighborhood.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Manu said,

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm not going.

15
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Do you think I look like...

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
You look like a vagabond.

17
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Guys, and Claudio?

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Where's Claudio? I've never heard of him.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't think he's back from Australia yet.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Claudio is a friend of ours who was very friendly.

21
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
He went to Australia, disappeared, blocked everyone.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you know who I saw the other day, honey?

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ritinha.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Ritinha is a friend of ours from college.

25
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Is she still with Paulo?

26
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Paulo is already married to Rosana.

27
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Paulo was Ritinha's boyfriend,

28
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
but he cheated on Ritinha with Rosane

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
at Ritinha's birthday party.

30
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Rosana, as far as I know,

31
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
she was wanting to go back with Renan.

32
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Really?

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you still working with Renan?

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Yes, but he changed his sector.

35
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Renan and Pedro are working together.

36
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Pedro got a job with Renan.

37
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Did you know he's really bad?

38
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Really bad.

39
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Cancer.

40
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Cancer is a horrible drug that kills a lot of people.

41
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, but he even went back to his home office job

42
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in Búzios because of that.

43
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Búzios is a city in Rio de Janeiro, close to Cabo Frio.

44
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is he going to operate, guys?

45
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Look, honey, the last thing I heard

46
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is that he's really bad.

47
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Bad, even though it's a fruit.

48
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
It's what we use to designate sadness.

49
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
He's really bad.

50
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Guys, let's order the menu.

51
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Let's order the menu?

52
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
Friends, the menu is a booklet

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,500
that the restaurant sends us

54
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
to see the food list.

55
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Marquinho, what the hell is this?

56
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

57
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Are you going to keep saying everything,

58
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
translating everything we say to her?

59
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,000
I translated...

60
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now she's pissed off

61
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because I'm translating everything

62
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,500
No, I'm not pissed off, honey.

63
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
I just want to understand the situation.

64
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,500
And now he's being passive-aggressive.

65
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,000
He's always like that.

66
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What did you understand, man?

67
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, Marquinho, Marquinho.

68
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Stop it so we don't keep talking here.

69
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
We're here as friends.

70
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're here as friends.

71
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now she's defending him,

72
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
something she always does.

73
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
What's this?

74
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,000
What's this?

75
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Where did you get this?

76
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It has nothing to do with it.

77
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,500
What?

78
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Now she's upset

79
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
because it may seem like

80
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
she's been in a relationship with Pedro for seven years,

81
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
even though she's Pedro's best friend.

82
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
What do you mean?

83
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Do you have a relationship?

84
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Do you have a relationship?

85
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,000
No, Marquinho.

86
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is Marquinho's joke.

87
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Now everyone knows.

88
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is something that wouldn't have happened

89
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
if it weren't for Tom Climão.

90
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,500
No, seriously.

91
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
You can only be mad at me.

92
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look, did everyone know about this?

93
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Of course.

94
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't know.

95
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
I knew more or less about you.

96
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Fuck you, Marcos.

97
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Now he's mad at me.

98
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Cesar, you...

99
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Look, you don't talk to me anymore.

100
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You never talk to me again.

101
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Now she said she wouldn't talk to her anymore.

102
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,000
No, friend.

103
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now she's yelling.

104
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She's desperate.

105
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Now if it's with Climão,

106
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to try a conversation.

107
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Guys, what about the fire?

108
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
It didn't go out.

109
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
But how did he manage to cheat on her?

110
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
He cheated on her.

111
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
And before that, he had cheated on Renan?

112
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
No, Renan doesn't cheat on anyone.

113
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
He's the one who cheated on her.

114
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
But he...

115
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,000
And...

116
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And Ritinha was cheated on.

117
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In Búzios?

118
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, there's no Búzios.

119
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Búzios?

120
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Búzios is the home office.

121
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
And Australia?

122
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Who was in Australia?

123
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Was it her who was in Australia

124
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
while he was in Australia?

125
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Was he cheating on her?

126
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
No.

127
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
It was someone else who was in Australia.

128
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Búzios?

129
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Búzios.

130
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Stay in Búzios.

131
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Australia isn't in Búzios.

132
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
No, but...

133
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
What about cancer?

134
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
What's wrong with cancer?

135
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Cancer?

136
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Is he having cancer?

137
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Not him.

138
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
It's Renan who's having cancer.
